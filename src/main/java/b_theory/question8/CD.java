    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Software Delivery is the process of getting a software product to market.

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
    // ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [+] test
    // [+] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 Improved Productivity and Efficiency: Significant time savings for developers, testers, operations engineers, etc. through automation.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // Customer preferences: Some customers do not want continuous updates to their systems. This is especially true at the critical stages in their operations.

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // More important to start is CI, because CI have tests for compilation
    // Interesting fact ->
    // CI/CD: When the build is broken, fixing it should be the priority for the team. And the importance of fixing it should be a shared mindset in the culture.
    // Because: Every time a build is broken, no one else can continue pushing code changes.
